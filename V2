-- Version 2 - Basic banking app: Achieves the same objective 
--  as Version 1 without needing a SELECT statement with the 
-- update lock. Instead uses the ROWCOUNT function.

BEGIN TRAN;
	UPDATE Accounts SET
		Balance -= 400
	WHERE AccountID = 47387438 AND Balance >= 400

	IF(@@ROWCOUNT <> 1)
	BEGIN
		ROLLBACK TRAN;
		THROW 50000, 'There are insufficient funds to make this withdrawal', 1;
	END
COMMIT TRAN
